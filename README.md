## Oxygen Framework for the transcription medieval poetry

This is a general purpose Oxygen Author Mode Framework designed to aid in the transcription of medieval manuscripts with texts in verse. It can be used both for lyrical or narrative poetry. The underlying encoding principles are those of [heiEditions](https://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/publikationsdienste/digitale_editionen.html) which are fundamented in [heiConcepts](https://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/publikationsdienste/heieditions-concepts.html). Those guidelines offer a very rich and appropriate way to encode medieval texts, but the framework could be adapted for other encoding criteria.

Verses are displayed in a line, grouped according to stanzas (or pair rhyme for many narrative texts). Several visualization options are available to improve readability (abbreviations vs. expansions; paleographich transcription vs. regularization and correction; editorial comments (note) can be hidden). Many common elements and attributes can be entered with simple buttons or keyboard shortcuts.


This is a generalization of the framework created originally for the Iwein project, so some features might still not be basic enough. A full documentation will come at some point.
